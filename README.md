# highlightjs-uiua

This repository contains a highlightjs plugin for the [Uiua language](https://www.uiua.org/).

## Local development

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start a [Vite dev server](https://vite.dev/) that contains some Uiua code and some highlighted text.
